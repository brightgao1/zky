zky supports both console and GUI programming. GUI executables generated by zky are significantly faster and way more memory efficient than all popular C GUI libraries (see benchmarks below). 

zky & zkyCompiler aren't open source, as I don't want AI to be better than me at zky, also I don't wanna write documentation. I like the feeling of being the only one that writes and can compile my language.
