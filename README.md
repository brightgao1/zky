zky supports both console and GUI programming. GUI executables generated by zky are significantly faster and way more memory efficient than all popular C GUI libraries (see benchmarks below). 

zky & zkyCompiler aren't open source, as I don't want AI to be better than me at zky, also I don't wanna write documentation. I like the feeling of being the only one that writes and can compile my language. Also u have to switch keyboards every few characters, so not practical at all.

### Benchmarks
In the vid below, I create a zky GUI app w/ BrightWin (my Windows Subsystem), then compile it (F5 in my IDE). zkyCompiler pops up and compiles & runs the app. As u can see, the blank window app uses 1.1 MB of RAM and is 12 KB.

The table below shows benchmarks for an empty GUI app, as seen in vid above. 
| Language | Memory usage | Size | 
| :------: | :----------: | :--: |
| zky | 1.1 MB | 12 KB |
